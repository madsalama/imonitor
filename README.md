# imonitor
Dynamic inotify monitoring daemon

# Motivation
- I became interested in system programming, so I find this quite an educational project to start with. 
- Supporting/provisioning multiple legacy application instances for my job, I had to manually keep lists of configuration changes for multiple applications, projects, environments; because some environments where outdated by the time new projects were to use them.
  - This was becoming an unneccassary tracking hassle; because it's very error prone - but very automatable!
