# Motivation

- Working on multiple legacy applications for my job, I had to manually keep lists of configuration changes for multiple applications, projects, environments; because some environments where outdated by the time new projects were to use them.
- This was becoming an unneccassary hassle; because it's very error prone - but very automatable!
- I am interested in an entry project in system programming so this is quite an educational project.
