# Motivation

- Working on multiple legacy applications for my job, I had to keep lists of changes for multiple applications, multiple projects on multiple environments; because some environments where outdated by the time new projects required to use them. 
- This was becoming an unneccassary hassle; because it's very error prone but very automatable.
- I am interested in an entry project in system programming so this is quite an educational project.
