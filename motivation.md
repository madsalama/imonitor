# Motivation
- I am interested in system programming, so this is quite an educational project to start.
- Working on multiple legacy applications for my job, I had to manually keep lists of configuration changes for multiple applications, projects, environments; because some environments where outdated by the time new projects were to use them.
  - This was becoming an unneccassary tracking hassle; because it's very error prone - but very automatable!
