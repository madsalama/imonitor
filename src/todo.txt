-1- handle trailing '\n' char when listing watch paths
-2- cache watch_list; if watch_list not changed;
respond with cached result instead of going through the whole list again. (expensive strcat!)

-3- handle issue when MAX_WATCH is large(tried +4000), server crashes...
could be related to...

// ~ 5KB/WATCH
struct watch_data{
        int wd;
        char path[PATH_MAX]; // stack allocated while wtable is on heap?
};

struct watch_data* wtable; // MAX_WATCH structs calloced

-4- implementation for handling polling inotify watches.
-5- implementation to handle the required report formatting according to watch events.
