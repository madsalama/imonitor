-1- handle trailing '\n' char when listing watch paths
-2- cache watch_list; if watch_list not changed;
respond with cached result instead of going through the whole list again. (expensive strcat!)

-3- implementation for handling polling inotify watches.
-4- implementation to handle the required report formatting according to watch events.
